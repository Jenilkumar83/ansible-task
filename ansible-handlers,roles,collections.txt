Handlers:
tasks triggered by events/notifications
defined in playbook, executed when notified by task
manage actions based on system state/configuration changes

Roles:
make your work re-usable
in that we can separate in diff dir like vars,templates,tasks,defaults,handlers,etc

$ ansible-galaxy init -- to initialize and create a dir structure, for create a role from scratch
we can find role by default at /etc/ansible/roles  this defined in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
as roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles

find role: $ ansible-galaxy search role_name
use role: $ ansible-galaxy install role_name, if want to create in current dir then use: $ ansible-galaxy install role_name -p ./roles
list role: $ ansible-galaxy list
to find location: $ ansible-config dump | grep ROLE

Collections: 
-package and ditribute modules,roles,plugins,etc 
-self contained
-community and vendor-created

benefits:
-expanded functionality
-modularity and reusability
-simplified distribution and management
