Playbook - a single yaml file
play - set of tasks to be run hosts
task - action to be perform on the host--execute command,run script,install package, etc

host or groups is first defined in inventory file

the diff actions run by tasks are called modules.

Verifying playbooks:
provides diff modes like check mode, diff mode or main one
check mode: dry run mode, without making any actual changes on the hosts,
            to run playbook in check mode use --check option.
diff mode: provides a before-and-after comparison of playbook changes, --diff

syntax check:
to run --syntax-check option like this
ansible-playbook --syntax-check configure_database.yml

ansible-lint:
is a command-line tool that performs linting on ansible playbooks, roles & collections.
it checks code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors and suspicious constructs.
it shows like whitespace remain, name should present for all tasks

Conditional:
when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat" or
      ansible_os_family == "SUSE"
loop: "{{ packages }}"

ansible_facts -- when:ansible_facts['os_family'] == 'debian' and ansible_facts['distribution_major_version'] == '18'
vars -- app_env: production

loops:-
with_* -- with_items, with_files, with_url, etc
