Ansible uses yaml language.
Ansible Playbook written in yaml file.

Ansible Playbooks are lists of tasks that automatically execute for your specified inventory or groups of hosts

Ansible configuration files:
/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
in this diff sections are avail like: defaults, inventory, privilege escalation, ssh connnection, colors etc
default locationn of inventory is: /etc/ansible/hosts

first priority run for configuration file is that what we made new path using env var that will run first.
.ansible.cfg -- in the user's home dir, this is run before default ansible configuration file

$ ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit ansible-playbook playbook.yml -- this is only for single playbook app, single command

if want for through out shell:
$ export ANSIBLE_GATHERING=explicit
$ ansible-playbook playbook.yml

if want anywhere in other shell then make it local copy of that config file in playbook dir.

$ ansible-config list
$ ansible-config view   --  to see currently working active
$ ansible-config dump	--	shows the current settings Ansible has picked up and from where/mostly used at troubleshooting time
